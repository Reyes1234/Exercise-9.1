# Exercise 9.1
Add inheritance and sub-classes, build on last week's character class
There are some properties, or attributes, of characters in a game that are  
common to all characters
Do a basic role playing game example, & consider the attributes
Starting with your Character class from last week, build out at least 2 new
character types that extend Character
Each character type should have 1 new property that is unique to it's type, &
also 1 method (ability) that other characters don't have
Include code that shows instances of each character, & how to demonstrate their
abilities
